Who is this book for? What\u0026rsquo;s the future of this book?    The story and an overview of my book Essential Statistics for Non-STEM Data Analysts\nTestimonials  I’m about halfway through the book so far and really enjoying it. It’s a great mix of conceptual with practical, includes code following up-to-date best practices and standards, and is a great refresher if you’re seasoned, but also awesome if you’re new to analysis with Python!    I wish I\u0026rsquo;d had this book from the beginning of my journey. The graphics make it very easy to understand what we are talking about and the code is broken down and functional enough to make it easy and clear to understand the point. Li has the insight and clarity to teach data science in a way that even a 5 year old could understand. Absolutely recommend his book, for both stem and non-stem majors.    I came to this book with the perspective of a non-STEM professional who is transitioning into a Data Science career - so it seemed like it could be an ideal resource for someone with my profile, and that is indeed the case!    Overall, the book is well written and covers most of the statistical topics to get started into data science. I would recommend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of Python that wants to get a hands-on overview of statistics and get started with data science.    Overall, this book is a good reference to novice/experienced data scientists to refresh their statistics.    Like some other reviewers said, this book has a good balance of statistical concepts, math and python codes. The structure is good as each part has its specific focus. A very non-stem friendly book~   Why I wrote this book? The story of this book is actually pretty inspiring. Around December 2019, while I was waiting for my OPT to get approved, I wanted to do something more meaningful and productive. I often went to a local library in Culver City, Los Angeles and absolutely loved it and the community of book lovers. I walked to the counter and said to the manager that I wanted to offer a free mini course of data science to the library patrons as a fan of the library.\nLater, we agreed on the format, the poster design, etc. In January 2020, the 7-week mini course started. About 10 patrons and I met every Tuesday late afternoon to cover topics including Python programming, basic statistics, webs scraping, visualization and even natural language processing. I carefully created the content and ensured the high quality of it. The audience loved it. Another librarian from a library in Monterey park even invited me to offer the mini course at her library. Unfortunately the COVID-19 forbade that and I began to work at ISI which limited my availability as well.\nWell, I discovered that there is a big gap in the background knowledge and even the vocabulary usage between people who received formal STEM training like me (master in electrical engineering and an unfinished PhD ABD in physics) and people who are not very comfortable with math. How to help people who are making this transformation into the analytics era?\nI did some research and found out that no existing books in the market met the goal of filling this gap. In my opinion, you have to speak the language of your audience, without distorting your original meaning, to be heard and understood. So I drafted a book proposal and wrote a sample chapter, submitted to a book editor I found on LinkedIn and the rest is just the long long time of writing, editing and rewriting, etc.\nThanks to my editor Sean Lobo, my tech reviewers and language reviewer Michael Hansen. See, if you don\u0026rsquo;t write English well, they will get you a language reviewer.\nWho is this book for? This book is designed for non-STEM people. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a STEM major or didn\u0026rsquo;t get college education at all, this book is for you.\nYou need some essential Python programming skills to reproduce the examples in the book. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have any experience in Python, this page will give you a quick start. The notebooks for the code in the book is in this repository.\nIf the readers are experienced in data science or machine learning, there is no need for you to read this book. Please don\u0026rsquo;t give a bad rating on Amazon because it is too easy. Instead, I recommend the following books to such readers.\n Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop.  What\u0026rsquo;s the future of this book? Well, I am closely monitoring the review of the book on Amazon, comments from my friends, students and colleagues. I plan to keep updating the book\u0026rsquo;s content so it reflects the market\u0026rsquo;s need for data analysts and scientists. Feel free to reach out to me to provide your insights. Your name will show up in future editions' preface 😀.\n","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"8ac485821d5a364deecae06a7a463a49","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/essential-stats/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/essential-stats/","section":"publication","summary":"The title [Essential Statistics for Non-STEM Data Analysts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1838984844?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER\u0026ref=mpc_asin_title) speaks for it.

Why are you interested in teaching STEM subjects? What should non-STEM students know going into an educational bootcamp? What’s your observation regarding people leaving their career versus people elaborating on their career with new skills? What is your suggestion for non-STEM professionals interested in coding bootcamps? You mentioned storytelling. Can you elaborate on that? How do you define storytelling? What is good storytelling? Sounds like a data scientist needs to be a salesperson. You have expressed that knowing is not necessarily better than not knowing. What does that mean? What are your suggestions for incoming non-STEM professionals?  Can you introduce yourself? My name is Ron (Rongpeng) Li. I am a data science instructor at Galvanize Los Angeles campus. Before that, I was a research programmer at Information Sciences Institute, a research branch of The University of Southern California. I studied physics, computer science, and electrical engineering when I was a graduate student.\nWhy are you interested in teaching STEM subjects? I have been very enthusiastic about teaching STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), especially to people without formal training. At Galvanize, almost all my students come from non-STEM backgrounds. It is well known that there is a gap between the skills, the mindset, and sometimes even the vocabulary used between the tech fields and the non-STEM domain. This may cause students to doubt their confidence and skills. However, I find that the advantages of the non-STEM professionals who transit to the tech domain are less discussed. I would love to bring people’s attention and appreciation to them.\nAlthough I only teach data science, I strongly believe what I am going to discuss applies to other tech domains as well. I will use data science for explaining purposes in the conversation.\nWhat should non-STEM students know going into an educational bootcamp? Non-STEM students should know that expertise domain knowledge is more important than specific data science skills in the long run. To clarify some possible misunderstandings first, the data skills are definitely important and they are the main reason why students join our bootcamp. However, I find that students have two very different mindsets. Some of them want to change their career completely, leaving their domain. Another group of students want to stay in their domain of expertise but lift their tech skills.\nWhat’s your observation regarding people leaving their career versus people elaborating on their career with new skills? I didn’t have many students, so I have to observe on LinkedIn as well. My impression is that students who try to completely leave their previous expertise find it VERY hard but the second group may find it more comfortable to tell a consistent story. Honestly, it is not realistic to start in a new domain by simply claiming that you know how random forests work. Sometimes you aim at a scientist job but end up with an analyst job or even no job for a long time. The frustration is pretty detrimental.\nWhat is your suggestion for non-STEM professionals interested in coding bootcamps? My suggestion is that students shouldn’t think of learning data science skills as a COMPLETE shift of career, at least in the beginning, but a full upgrade of their understanding of their original domain with new skills and perspectives. For example, if you work for a sales team, without data science skills, you are only capable of seeing a fracture of the business. With data science, you can do many other things. This is your story to tell. It is just not possible to get to the music industry to recommend music to people just because you joined the tech bootcamp. For those who really wish to shift their careers, I have two suggestions. First, because your background is always your advantage over other candidates, you should consider starting the transition by finding the intersection of your background and your dream job. It is not hard: for example, if you come from a sales background and are working on software that recommends music to listeners, your software is essentially a sales tactic if you think about it. Why should someone listen to a song? Try to frame your story by using your background expertise.Second, you need really, really good projects to impress people. I would say a WOW-level project. One of such examples that impressed me is a covid-19 infection prediction app. It was very well done.\nYou mentioned storytelling. Can you elaborate on that? Sure. This is actually the second point I want to make. I find, in general, non-STEM students have particularly good skills of storytelling. You can say storytelling is a byproduct of working experience, even for people who aren’t natural storytellers.\nHow do you define storytelling? What is good storytelling? I define storytelling as a special kind of sales. Galvanize has rigorous graduation requirements, so other than rare cases beyond 3 sigmas, most graduates have roughly the same skill levels. They are essentially qualified for entry-level data analyst or data scientist jobs. The big differences are in the soft skills. For example, some students are very sensitive to numbers and they are visibly excited about increase of model accuracy. However, such students often fail to address the reason why we want high accuracy.\nA non-STEM professional with working experience knows the relationship between impact and motivation. You want to make an impact or solve a problem first, and then you bring data science into the room. I had a student who is really into role play. When he gave a presentation, he set up a scene and assigned himself a role. He then created some background information and started from there. This may seem weird, but I sincerely think it is very down-to-earth and necessary. Galvanize data science instructors are also discussing possibilities to bring more business-oriented scenarios into the curriculum like role-playing.\nIn terms of good storytelling in data science, I think good storytelling requires a sense of the big picture. I think it is also the reason why tools like BI platforms, which are more and more automatic and intelligent, will not replace data scientists. A good data scientist should know the data aspect well, but should also know the assumptions for the questions being studied, why the data part is necessary, and most importantly, the scope of the possible impact. Including these factors in a data science project makes the project an enjoyable story that doesn’t make people frown. I am not in favor of a particular format of storytelling. Dashboards, reports, animations, or even plain text are all fine options to me.\nSounds like a data scientist needs to be a salesperson.  Right. To be a data scientist, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition to be a good salesperson.\nYou have expressed that knowing is not necessarily better than not knowing. What does that mean? I have chosen my words very precisely. First of all, it is almost always better to know certain knowledge or skills than not knowing them. However, in the bootcamp case, all graduates will reach roughly the same level when graduating. In terms of learning performance, I find sometimes students who are exposed to new ideas for the first time did a better job in terms of understanding and internalizing them.\nTo provide an example, we did a cross-campus interview to allow instructors from other campuses to interview my students. One of the students said that it was a great idea because the students are likely overfitted to the current instructors. I was shocked. His comments showed that he fully understood the concept of overfitting and can create jokes using the concept. I am not saying that years of experience or formal education in STEM is not useful. I am saying that there is no issue (at least, no disadvantages) for non-STEM professionals to step into the domain without prior experience. The screening process at Galvanize DSI program ensures that, if you are admitted, we think you are prepared. If your classmates were in chemical engineering majors, they may have learned linear algebra during their time in college, but they were likely not learning it specifically in the context of something like principal component analysis… but now you may find yourselves in that situation during the bootcamp. Our curriculum teaches everything you need to know in the context of data science.\nWhat are your suggestions for incoming non-STEM professionals? First of all, bring back the mindset of a student. Learning is probably a long-lost practice. As a student, you will meet challenges. Don’t let the difficulties slip away. Try to manage your time properly so you have time to review and refresh. This will refresh old memories but also build your confidence. Soon, you will find that the dots are connected. Your programming skills influence how well you can understand others’ code and your understanding of machine learning algorithms determines how fast you can translate them into codes. Don’t let this connection make data science hard to crack into but make it a positive feedback loop. The start is always the most difficult.\nIf you’re looking for more content, I would recommend listening to an episode of the Galvanize Podcast. It is about a full-time mom’s story of transitioning to the tech industry, which is very impressive.\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"6d02e4ecd73d114025bc512026ff9776","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/stem-advantage/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/stem-advantage/","section":"post","summary":"We had a [conversation](https://blog.galvanize.com/the-unique-advantages-of-non-stem-professionals-in-tech-bootcamps/) with Ron Li, Data Analytics Instructor at Galvanize Los Angeles, to discuss the unique advantages that non-STEM professionals have in bootcamps like Galvanize’s Data Science Immersive bootcamp.","tags":["STEM","English"],"title":"The unique advantages of non-STEM professionals in tech bootcamps","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606435200,"objectID":"2b45980677e716f056f96c34372fe4cf","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/essential-book/","publishdate":"2020-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/essential-book/","section":"project","summary":"I wrote a book during the pandemic lockdown, 2020.

This talk is a rough survey of visualizations about COVID-19 as November 2020. I collected several representative visualizations and analyzed them in a systematic, scientific way, essentially three key steps.\n What is the information the visualization tries to convey? Is it in agreement with scientific consensus? Is the data reliable? Does the data contain the intended information in principle? What kind of plot and aesthetic elements does the visualization use? Do such visual elements help or not?  Why did I Give This Talk? Visualization is supposed to convert data into more informative, digestible format so readers without too much analytical training can grasp the ideas or situations the data contains. This is especially important during the age of crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI believe in a public crisis like COVID-19, The most important thing for data science is to precisely and exactly convey the objective information. Even when the data is of high quality and the visualization is correct, the data scientists should inform the readers the possible judgmental consequences of the data preprocessing, transformation and aesthetic choices. In many cases data scientists think this is unnecessary or omit such information. However, when the audience is general public, these self-discrediting footnotes become a corner-stone for reliability and trustworthiness.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the Future of the Talk You may find the original code for the presentation here: rongpenl/pydata-global-covid-visualization.\nThe age of misinformation and information diabetes is upon us. Misinformation and echo chamber effect caused by recommendation algorithm already caused tremendous amount of damage to the society of United States and around the globe. This talk inspired me to write a book called Practical Digital Civics by a Data Scientist to combat such threat. As January 2021, I am finalizing the draft of this book.\n","date":1605186000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605186000,"objectID":"e142cf97b245f57112570b3241108927","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talk/covid-19-visualizations-the-good-the-bad-and-the-malicious/","publishdate":"2020-11-12T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/covid-19-visualizations-the-good-the-bad-and-the-malicious/","section":"event","summary":"A systematic survey of the visualization of COVID-19 data.","tags":[],"title":"COVID-19 Visualizations, the Good, the Bad and the Malicious","type":"event"},{"authors":["Rongpeng Li (Ron)","Chi H.
