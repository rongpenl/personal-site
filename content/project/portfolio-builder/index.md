title: One-Click Portfolio Builder
summary: Many of my students don't have a personal portfolio website. I created a simple workflow for them to create one to show off their work as well as a LinkedIn [talk](https://www.linkedin.com/events/buildaportfoliowebsitein30minut6804820582664937472/) to teach how to use it.
