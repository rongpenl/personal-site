abstract: We theoretically investigated the variable mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratios and compressibility in super-hard materials. Our tensorial analysis reveals that the mechanical properties of super-hard materials are strongly sensitive to the anisotropy index of materials. I
