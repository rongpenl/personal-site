abstract: Base pairing plays a pivotal role in DNA functions and replication fidelity. But while the complementarity between Watsonâ€“Crick matched bases is generally believed to arise from the different number of hydrogen bonds in G|C pairs versus A|T, the energetics of these interactions are heavily renormalized by the aqueous solvent. Employing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we have extracted the solvent contribution to the free energy for canonical and some noncanonical and stacked base pairs.
